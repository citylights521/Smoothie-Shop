# Smoothie-Shop
What’s better than an ice cold, freshly blended, bursting with flavor and nutrients smoothie?! Saddle up to the Smoothie Shop and order a tall one of your fav. When you’re ready, devour it. Cheers!

Smoothie Shop is a full-stack app that was created using several components (see below for a full list). It follows the MVC design pattern, and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data into the app, and generates the HTML the user sees from Handlebars. 

## Components Used

* Express
* Clear DB

## How to Use
To get started ordering smoothies, open up the app. There will be a few orders available in case you’d like one of those. Alternatively you can type a smoothie into the available field. Once you submit your order, it will populate on the left hand side of the screen, where all available smoothies generate. Once you click ‘devour it’, the smoothie will pop over to the right hand side of the screen and will no longer be available to devour. Using Heroku, Clear DB and MySQL, Smoothie Shop maintains data persistence.

##Feedback
Second full-stack project is in the books with this one. Adding MVC was a learning curve but in general I like the fact that information can be organized in a consistent way. Clear DB, why do you auto-increment ID’s by 10 automatically without the ability to edit?! For this project that wasn’t a deal breaker but it could be for others. The different tools may have little quirks which you find when you are deep in the weeds. I am finding that any time something will take ‘two minutes’ you should read minutes as hours (joking, but also kind of serious). I wish this app was a little more interactive/interesting on the front end but it was a back-end exercise and was valuable in understanding how the different pieces of the back-end come together to create the final result.
